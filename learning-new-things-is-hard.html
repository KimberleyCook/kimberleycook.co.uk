        <p>A few weeks back I got talking to someone who was told by another new developer that learning that learning CSS and Javascript is easy. This upset me for many reasons.</p>

        <p>Firstly learning CSS and Javascript is not easy. I have been a developer for 6 years now and there are so many thigns surrounding these languages that I do not know. I learn something new on a daily basis.

        <p>Learning something new is NEVER easy. Particualarly learning 2 new programming languages at the same time. It upset me that this girls told me how she felt rubbish for not feeling the same way as theese other new developers. It upsets me that she now feels all the heard work she is putting into learning these languages is not enough</p>

        <p>So please do not EVER tell someone who is learning something new that what they're learning is easy. It is easy for you as you already know this. Learning something completely new, particularly a new progarmming language, is never easy. Actually no, leanrning anything new is easy. BAck last year I tried teaching my 24 year-old housemate to ride a bike. Of course I find riding a bike easy, I do it almost everyday, but to her this is very difficult. There is absolutely no poitn me telling her constantly that is easy becuase it is easy for me, not her.</p>

        <p>You do not realise that by you saying something is easy can make someone feel extremely bad about the efforts they aere putting in.</p>
